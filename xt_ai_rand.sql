1. Here's an exercise that combines JOIN and SELECT to simulate a real-world cybersecurity scenario:
Scenario: You have two tables, Users and Logins, that store user information and login activity respectively. 
  You need to detect any suspicious login attempts by identifying users who have logged in from different 
  countries within a short period of time.
Table Structures:
Users table:
- id (INT)
- username (VARCHAR)
- email (VARCHAR)
Logins table:
- id (INT)
- user_id (INT)
- login_time (DATETIME)
- country_code (VARCHAR)
SQL Exercise:
1. Create and populate the Users and Logins tables with sample data.
2. Write a SQL query that joins the Users and Logins tables and selects users who have logged in 
  from different countries within a specific time frame (e.g., 1 hour).

Using the database schema we've discussed (users, content_reports, user_account_actions, and content), answer the following:

TABLE: users: Contains user information.
user_id (INT, Primary Key)
account_creation_date (DATE)
country (VARCHAR)
account_status (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Active', 'Suspended', 'Closed')

TABLE: content
content_id (INT, Primary Key)
user_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.user_id)
content_type (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Video', 'Post', 'Comment')
creation_date (DATE)

TABLE: content_reports: Contains reports of potentially abusive content.
report_id (INT, Primary Key)
content_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing a content table - not included here for simplicity)
reporting_user_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.user_id, users who made the report)
report_type (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Harassment', 'Hate Speech', 'Spam')
report_date (DATE)
report_status_date (DATE)
status (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Pending', 'Reviewed', 'Actioned', 'Dismissed')

TABLE: user_account_actions: Contains records of actions taken against user accounts.
action_id (INT, Primary Key)
user_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing users.user_id)
action_type (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Suspension', 'Warning', 'Account Closure')
action_date (DATE)
reason (VARCHAR, e.g., 'Pending', 'Reviewed', 'Actioned', 'Dismissed')

This exercise focuses on grouping and counting from a single table.

Exercise:

Count Total Actions per User: Write a SQL query to count the total number of actions (e.g., Suspensions, Warnings) taken against each user in the user_account_actions table. Show the user_id and the total_actions_count.

Filter and Count Specific Actions: Write a query to count only the 'Suspension' actions for each user. Show the user_id and the total_suspensions.
