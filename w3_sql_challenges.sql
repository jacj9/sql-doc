-- 1. From the following tables, write a SQL query to find the information on each salesperson of ABC Company. Return name, city, country and state of each salesperson.

SELECT first_name, last_name, city, state, country
FROM salesperson a
LEFT JOIN address ON a.salesperson_id = b.salesperson_id;


-- 2. From the following table, write a SQL query to find the third highest sale. Return sale amount.

SELECT MAX(sale_amt) AS ThirdHighestSale
FROM salemast
WHERE sale_amt <
(
  SELECT MAX(sale_amt)
  FROM salemast
  WHERE sale_amt <
    (
    SELECT MAX(sale_amt)
    FROM salemast
    )
);


-- Retry exercise 2 using LIMIT OFFSET
SELECT MAX(sale_amt) AS ThirdHighestSale
FROM salemast
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2; -- Display one value starting from third value


-- 3. From the following table, write a SQL query to find the Nth highest sale. Return sale amount.

SELECT MAX(sale_amt) AS getNthHighestSaleAmt
FROM salemast;


-- 4. From the following table, write a SQL query to find the marks, which appear at least thrice one after another without interruption. Return the number.

SELECT DISTINCT marks
FROM (
  SELECT marks,
          LAG(marks) OVER (ORDER BY student_id) AS prev_marks,
          LEAD(marks) OVER (ORDER BY student_id) AS next_marks
  FROM logs
  ) subquery
WHERE marks = prev_marks AND marks = next_narks;

-- Another Solution
SELECT DISTINCT L1.marks AS  ConsecutiveNums
FROM (logs L1 JOIN logs L2 ON L1.marks = L2.marks AND L1.student_id = L2.student_id-1) -- L1 and L2 match in marks, and L2 student_id shoulb be exactly one more than L1's student_id
JOIN logs L3 ON L1.marks = L3.marks AND L2.student_id = L3.student_id-1; -- L1 and L3 should match in marks, and L3 shold be exactly one more L2's student_id


-- 5. From the following table, write a SQL query to find all the duplicate emails (no upper case letters) of the employees. Return email id.

SELECT email_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY email_id
HAVING COUNT(email_id)>1;


-- 6. From the following tables, write a SQL query to find those customers who never ordered anything. Return customer name.

SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN
(SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders);


-- 7. From the following table, write a SQL query to remove all the duplicate emails of employees keeping the unique email with the lowest employee id. Return employee id and unique emails.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, email_id) VALUES
(101, 'Liam Alton', 'li.al@abc.com'),
  (102, 'Josh Day', 'jo.da@abc.com'),
  (103, 'Sean Mann', 'se.ma@abc.com'),
  (104, 'Evan Blake', 'ev.bl@abc.com'),
  (105, 'Toby Scott', 'jo.da@abc.com');

SELECT DISTINCT email_id, employee_id
FROM employees;

-- Retry again

SELECT * FROM employees;

DELETE e1 FROM employees e1,  employees e2 -- This query deletes duplicate rows from the employees table based on the email_id column.
WHERE
    e1.email_id = e2.email_id  -- The condition identifies rows with duplicate email_id values
  AND e1.employee_id > e2.employee_id; -- The condition ensures that the row with the larger employee_id is the one to be deleted

SELECT * FROM employees;
