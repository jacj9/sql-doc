FROM salemast
WHERE sale_amt <
(
  SELECT MAX(sale_amt)
  FROM salemast
  WHERE sale_amt <
    (
    SELECT MAX(sale_amt)
    FROM salemast
    )
);


-- Retry exercise 2 using LIMIT OFFSET
SELECT MAX(sale_amt) AS ThirdHighestSale
FROM salemast
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2; -- Display one value starting from third value


-- 3. From the following table, write a SQL query to find the Nth highest sale. Return sale amount.

SELECT MAX(sale_amt) AS getNthHighestSaleAmt
FROM salemast;


-- 4. From the following table, write a SQL query to find the marks, which appear at least thrice one after another without interruption. Return the number.

          LEAD(marks) OVER (ORDER BY student_id) AS next_marks
  FROM logs
  ) subquery
WHERE marks = prev_marks AND marks = next_narks;

-- Another Solution
SELECT DISTINCT L1.marks AS  ConsecutiveNums
FROM (logs L1 JOIN logs L2 ON L1.marks = L2.marks AND L1.student_id = L2.student_id-1) -- L1 and L2 match in marks, and L2 student_id shoulb be exactly one more than L1's student_id
JOIN logs L3 ON L1.marks = L3.marks AND L2.student_id = L3.student_id-1; -- L1 and L3 should match in marks, and L3 shold be exactly one more L2's student_id
