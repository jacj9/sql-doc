Here is where I document SQL journey. This is where I upload exercises from different sources such as Job Ready SQL, W3, and others.

natural join, using, Subquery, add data to script, cd, mysqldump

Some important commands to review:

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN
GRANT, REVOKE, transaction controls

Basics to review:

Query a Database: FROM, ORDER BY, SELECT

Apply Filters: AND, OR, BETWEEN, =, >, >=, <=, LIKE, NOT, <>, !=, %, _, WHERE

Join tables: FULL OUTER JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN

Perform Calculations: AVG, COUNT, SUM
